# ReactionMiner

ReactionMiner is a tool to predict (bio)chemical reactions using graph mining. It currently is built on the KEGG database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your computer using `git`, or [download the entire repository](https://github.com/aravindsankar28/ReactionMiner/archive/master.zip) and decompress it.
2. Unzip `data.zip` in its current (root) directory
3. `jbliss` needs to be installed, by using `make` command. In the `Makefile`, edit the path of the `JNI_H` and `JNI_MD_H` libraries. Also change `libjbliss.dylib` to `libjbliss.so` while compiling, if on a Linux system.

## Using ReactionMiner to predict paths

1. Use `ReactionMiner/reactionMiner.sh` script to use the ReactionMiner prediction algorithm to predict pathways between a pair of molecules.  
2. For using an unknown molecule (not present in the KEGG database) as query, add the mol file to the `data/molStereo_Hadded_PH_CoA/` directory and use the name of the mol file in the query.
3. By default, pathway prediction will happen in the KEGG Universe. To predict paths in a different organism, an extra command line argument needs to be provided with the organism ID in the Path2Models database.

### Usage
````
cd ReactionMiner/ 
bash reactionMiner.sh -org_id  -source C00118 -target C00022 -paths 10
````
In this case, paths will be predicted between [C00118](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?cpd:C00118) and [C00022](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?cpd:C00022) in _E. coli_
